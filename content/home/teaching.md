* [Algebra I](https://impa.br/en_US/ensino/programas-de-formacao/mestrado-academico/disciplinas-mestrado-academico/algebra-i/) (2019)

Between 2014 and 2016, I was an educator at Projeto Ã‚ncora, an elementary school that implemented a revolutionary pedagogical approach at the time and was widely recognized as [a reference in innovative education in Brazil](http://innoveedu.org/en/ancora-project-school).
