Apart from working as a teaching assistant for basic undergraduate math courses (analytic geometry and linear algebra), I have taught high school math and physics for over a year at Emancipa (a volunteer-run, free of cost course for underprivileged students aiming for college).

After graduating, I worked for three years at Projeto Ã‚ncora, a school recognized by some surveys [among the most innovative in the world](http://innoveedu.org/en/ancora-project-school).
